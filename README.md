Wiegand Card Information Calculator
=======

**Discription:**
This is a tool to extract *decimal* information such as Card Number, Facility Code, and Issue Code from raw *Hexadecimal* card data using standard or custom Wiegand formats.

**To use:**
Download and run the compiled *HexCalc.exe*.

Alternatively, download the source-code and run *HexCalc.ahk* using [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/download/).  This tool was built using v1.1.30, though it should work with any AutoHotKey v1.1.x builds.

**Note:**
The formats included with this tool have primarily been extracted from the truPortal access control system.  Others may be added as I find and test other formats, though I will not entertain the idea of adding proprietary formats.  The information generated from this tool is only a mathematical calculation, so it cannot guarantee that any data you enter here will necessarily be correct for your application. *I.e. if the format you configure in this tool does not match the format used by the credentials, the data extracted will not work in your system.*
